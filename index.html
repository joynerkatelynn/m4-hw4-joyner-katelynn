    <h1>Imagine Dragons</h1>
        <p>Imagine Dragons is a pop-rock band based in Las Vegas, Nevada.</p>

    <section id="about">
        <h2>About</h2>
             <p> 
                Imagine Dragons has been playing together since 2008 with the release of their debut single, "It's Time." The band's name is an inside joke among original members.
                After gaining a following in the Las Vegas area, Imagine Dragons released two EPs before their debut album, "Night Visions," dropped in September 2012. Their 
                second album, "Smoke + Mirrors," was released in February 16 to critical acclaim. The band has released four more albums since and embarked on five tours.
             </p>

             <p>
                Imagine Dragons describes their music as pop-rock, though they've also had indie, folk, hip-hop and even dubstep influences. Band frontman Dan Reynolds cites 
                Nirvana, Muse, The Beatles and Paul Simon as some of the band's main influences.

        <p>
            Originally from Salt Lake City, Utah, frontrunner Dan Reynolds grew up in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. Though he is no longer a practicing Mormon, he and the band have
            conducted several acts of activism to raise awareness around the Mormon treatment of the LGBTQ community. 
            In 2017, Reynolds and the band hosted the first annual LOVELOUD festival in Utah. LOVELOUD promotes several LGBTQ artists, including Neon Trees, WILLOW, and more. All proceeds from the concert
            go to local and nationwide LGBTQ charities.
